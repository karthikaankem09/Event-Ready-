## Project Sought
I am eagerly seeking a compelling capstone project that falls into one of two categories: 
1. crafting a distinctive application to aid students or 
2. constructing a visual tracking system designed to facilitate the translation of ASL signs. 
While I am steadfast in my interest in these areas, I remain open to exploring other project possibilities where I can make a meaningful contribution. My considerable experience in UX and UI design equips me to seek out a project that harnesses these skills, aiming for a project that is not only functionally robust but also aesthetically delightful.
