Part 1: User Story 

As a student event coordinator, I want to be able to prepare and host an event from start to finish. These steps will include brainstorming, setting goals and frameworks, allocating a budget, determining logistics, advertising, marketing, executing the event, and final debriefing and feedback. I want this application to be a “one-stop-shop” for event planning and execution.  

 

Also, as a student event coordinator, I want these niche services that I believe that most event planning applications lack:  

Attendance 

RSVP and Carpooling  

Automated Emails/Reminders 

Canva embeds for marketing flyers
